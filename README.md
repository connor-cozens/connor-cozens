### Hey there, I'm Connor! I'm currently a Software Developer at AWS, but aside from that...

- 🔭 I’m currently working with Western University on the [COVID-19 School Dashboard](https://github.com/connor-cozens/covid19-school-dashboard), an Ontario-based tool for mapping COVID cases with demographic data, and [Invest-Ed](https://github.com/connor-cozens/Invest-Ed), a dashboard and visualization of Womens' education across the Global South.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning backend and cloud service management, working with Google Cloud and AWS hosting multiple apps and learning management techniques as well as improving my Data Science skills through [Vector Institute's ML Internship for Black and Indigenous Students](https://vectorinstitute.ai/ml-classes-and-internships-for-black-indigenous-students/), being Métis myself.
